=  spring-boot-email-notification-service

This project is to sending email to customers in html template or plain text with attachments.
We built this as a micro service in order to send any kind of notification to customers like Email, SMS or Social Media Messages, etc.
So you can focus only on building real business value applications. You can create you own email template and override dynamic values from the client.
